# SAST Home Page ðŸ‘‹

This is a home page SSG project powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Getting Started ðŸš€

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Finally, build it:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

Do you want to see the preview page? run:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```
